# Every example of pattern matching (almost) from the docs

Really, it's a lot of examples from the docs. 

Plus some weird excursions, like Peano arithmetic (see Notebook 2), to illustrate pattern matching in recursion.

NOTE: This requires Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and [IElixir for Jupyter](https://github.com/pprzetacznik/IElixir).
